About 1.7 billion years ago, nature beat us to the punch by building its own nuclear reactor. In Gabon, Africa, a uranium deposit naturally hit critical mass and triggered a self-sustaining fission reaction that ran for hundreds of thousands of years. It functioned just like a modern power plant, but it was all a complete geological accident caused by the perfect mix of mineral deposits and groundwater.
