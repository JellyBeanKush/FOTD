  "The 2,000-year durability of ancient Roman concrete is attributed to a chemical process called 'hot mixing,' which incorporates microscopic lime clasts into the material. When structural cracks develop and allow water infiltration, these clasts dissolve and recrystallize as calcium carbonate, effectively self-healing the concrete and preventing the structural degradation that typically plagues modern Portland cement."
